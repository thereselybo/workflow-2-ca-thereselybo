## Goal

Build a microsite for SpaceX or NASA. This should focus on space technology.
A microsite is a branded, self-contained site, usually on a its own domain, with a single purpose and a limited number of pages. The purpose can be promotional or editorial, and be may linked to a specific event or period of time. A microsite is usually built as an addition to an existing brand website.

## Brief

- Create a microsite for SpaceX/NASA to raise awareness about space program activity around the world. The site should appeal to a specific target audience and provide links to more information, live feeds of launches, and so forth.
- The site should include a minimum of (4) pages, be responsive, and function well on a variety of platforms.
- The site should employ Javascript/JSON API for dynamic data and construction and styling of HTML/CS. While a calendar is not mandatory, some kind of schedule or timeline information is recommended.
- An HTML5 contact form with Javascript validation is required.
- The site should be well-designed and easy to use, and conform to WCAG standards.
- A detailed functional specification should be submitted.
- A Git repository should be set up specifically for this project
- Do not use Bootstrap or similar frameworks. We want to see your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
